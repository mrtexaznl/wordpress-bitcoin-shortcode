Mediterraneancoin button plugin
=====================

This Wordpress plugin providing a shortcode for showing links to Mediterraneancoin addresses
which can for example be used as a donation address.

Example shortcode:
[mediterraneancoin address="MeGbEre5ZyD3ug946sPuq5C6yy8ZPriwhf"]

The shortcode will insert a small button that links to the Bitcoin address. When
the mouse is hovered over the button a QR code representing the address is shown.
Further info on the address can be shown to the right of the button. This info is
fetched from the API at http://explorer.mediterraneancoin.org/.

To show the number of transactions the address has been used in:
[mediterraneancoin address="MeGbEre5ZyD3ug946sPuq5C6yy8ZPriwhf" info="transaction"]

To show the amount received by the address:
[mediterraneancoin address="MeGbEre5ZyD3ug946sPuq5C6yy8ZPriwhf" info="received"]

To show the current balance of the address:
[mediterraneancoin address="MeGbEre5ZyD3ug946sPuq5C6yy8ZPriwhf" info="balance"]

To show no info other than the address and QR code:
[mediterraneancoin address="MeGbEre5ZyD3ug946sPuq5C6yy8ZPriwhf" info="none"]

URL hints
---------
The bitcoin URLs can optionally include a label, a message and/or a suggested
amount to pay. These can be added to the URLs by setting the corresponding
setting on the shortcode. For example:
[mediterraneancoin address="MeGbEre5ZyD3ug946sPuq5C6yy8ZPriwhf" label="jonls.dk" amount="0.02" message="For donations to my projects"]

Widgets
-------
It is also possible to use shortcodes in widgets but this requires an additional
plugin to be installed (e.g http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/shortcodes-in-sidebar-widgets/).
